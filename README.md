Motion of 3 bodies under gravitational force

Given the initial positions and velocities of 3 bodies under gravitational force how will their motion look like?

This problem can only be solved numericaly.
In this code I have used Velocity Verlet algorithm to calculate the trajectories since it conserves the total energy of the system in the simulation which reduces errors as compared to Euler's algorithm
